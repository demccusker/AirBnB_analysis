In this project, I investigated data from AirBNB listings in Seattle from 2023, the most recent available version of this data. The data is available here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
I wanted to answer three main questions:
1. What neighborhoods have the highest average prices?
2. What neighborhoods have the highest average reviews?
3. What predicts price?

To investigate, I used two Jupyter notebooks. The first notebook, AirBNB_exploration, shows all of my attempts to wrangle the data and find answers to my research questions, as well as a few 
other questions I attemtped to answer but was unsucessful with. The second notebook, AirBNB_analysis, shows my final analysis without any of the detours or diversions. I used pandas, numpy,
sci-kit learn, matplotlib, and seaborn to complete my analyses. 

The conclusions I found show that if youâ€™re looking to buy something to list a new property on AirBNB, buy it in Pike-Market if you want to maximize your average price per night. However, there are opportunities in 
neighborhoods in Magnolia, Queen Anne, and North Seattle with high user reviews, which also represent substantial opportunities if you want to have a highly reviewed (and likely occupied!) unit. If at all possible,
rent a whole unit instead of a shared room or private room inside a larger home. 

To complete this project, I relied on code made available through Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree practice problems and examples.
